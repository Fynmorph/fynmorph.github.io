	I... guess I should make some introductions.</br></br>This is Agent Diao.</br>She was sent on an undercover mission to take out the human trafficking ring.</br></br>
	She's also the one who retrived that luggage.

	But.. I don't get it. Why are you here? Aren't you supposed to still be under surveillance?

	Yes I was, all the time during a whole year. I had to witness children getting raped and hit without being able to contact anyone. And I did things I didn't want.</br></br>
	
	Why didn't you tell me that kid was Aleksandre?

	Over? Why didn't you just tell me? Why did you hand me the briefcase then?

	So you see the consequences of your mistakes. I just didn't expect you let another of your subordinate try and open it.</br>But it doesn't matter now. You were too late.</br>

	You were looking for what was inside the private3 folder right? </br></br>Aleksandre moved everything he had stored in his computer into his shop.</br>
	Go there, the password is THEDEATH.</br></br>
	
	This is the final password Michail. Goodbye.
