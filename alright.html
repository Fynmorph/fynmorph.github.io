	<div class=msg>
	First open the suitcase.<br><br>The code is written on the paper which is upside down. It's '4', written in Chinese. So just input '<u>004</u>'.
	<hr> 
	Then, access to the session.<br><br>Open Paint, use the bucket on the face of Pedro and you'll see his scar: a crescent moon. So input '<u>moon</u>'.<hr>
	To use internet.<br><br>In pictures > other, you see a screenshot. Either type forum.html in the URL or look for that post on the internet using Google. You'll get the login '<u>doloko</u>' and password '<u>heaven</u>'.<hr>
	Private and Recycle Bin. <br><br>Aleksandre's true identity is the young blonde kid. So upload the <u>picture of Asiya</u>
	in the hidden shop to private. When you use Paint's bucket on his face, the chinese character for '<u>sky</u>' appears, which is the password for recycle bin.
	<hr>
	untitled.png hides the message 'He be dead'. Not that is matters.
	<hr>
	To remove the virus, just click on the antivirus icon (bottom right).
	<hr>
	Private 2<br><br>
	Go back to the suitcase, if you open it again, you'll see a sheet of paper sticking out. Click on it, you'll find a contract with fingerprints, the right one is Aleksandre's.<br><br>
	Open Paint, <a href="basic_paint.png">overlay</a> this print with the residue on the reader. You'll see the word '<u>HELL</u>' appearing; which is the password.
	<hr>
	Minesweeper<br><br>
	You should have gathered two pieces of torn paper. By combining them you get<br><a href="map.png">a map with the word SUN.</a> on it. It's a map to complete the minesweeper. Go complete it.
	<hr>
	Private3 Cross the river<br><br>
	If you know that Asiya is part of the human traffickers, there's no trick, only logic.<br>The password you get is '<u>the other side</u>' which is for private3.
	<hr>
	The hacker<br><br>
	
	Private3 is empty, so what? Your only choice is to contact someone who knows more: the mysterious hacker. Go turn off the antivirus first.
	<hr>
	The hidden website<br><br>
	You have to input THEDEATH using the 'Buy' buttons. Pay attention to the first letter of the names. So click in that order: Tabia - Haneul - Erik - Diao - Erik - Asiya - Tabia - Haneul.
